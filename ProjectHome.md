This software drives a chinese parking sensors instead of the original 8051 based controller to achieve a waterproof, quadruple Sonar Range Finder.
All the rest of the hardware remain the same. In this way it is possible to make any customization:
  * - changing finding range
  * - changing scanning period
  * - using different communication channels (e.g.: I2c or serial)
